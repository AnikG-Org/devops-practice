#Many applications running for long periods of time eventually transition to broken states, and cannot recover except by being restarted. Kubernetes provides liveness probes to detect and remedy such situations.
#Readiness probes are configured similarly to liveness probes. The only difference is that you use the 'readinessProbe' field instead of the 'livenessProbe' field.
#Kubernetes provides readiness probes to detect and mitigate these situations. A pod with containers reporting that they are not ready does not receive traffic through Kubernetes Services.
#Note: Readiness probes runs on the container during its whole lifecycle.
